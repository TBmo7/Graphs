First thing we need to do is get the exits of the room that we're currently in
if there are unexplored exits in the room . add room to unexplored options
if we explore all locations, there are no ? in the room, we remove from unexplored rooms
when we first explore a room > we log the room ID and the exits. 
when we move, we add out direction to the traversal path

We keep moving through rooms so long as we don't find ourselves in a room with 
all exits mapped, at that point look for a room that has "?" for an exit
